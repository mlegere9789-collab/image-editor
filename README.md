# image-editor

Desktop image editor, Tauri + Rust + React.

## Status

- **Phase 0** — Tauri + Rust + React shell that opens and displays a PNG. *Done.*
- **Phase 1** — the document model and compositor. *Done, described below.*
- **Phase 2** — composite delivery over a custom protocol instead of base64 IPC.
  *Done, described below.*

## Phase 1: document model and compositor

A document is a stack of layers. Each layer owns document-sized RGBA8 pixel data
plus **opacity**, a **blend mode**, and a **visibility** flag. The compositor
flattens the stack, bottom to top, into the single image on screen.

- **Open PNG…** starts a new document with that image as its only layer.
- **Add layer…** (or dropping a second file) stacks another image on top. The
  document keeps its original size: smaller images are pasted at the origin,
  larger ones are clipped.
- The layers panel lists the stack top-first. Per layer you can toggle
  visibility, set opacity, choose a blend mode, reorder, and delete.
- Every edit re-flattens in Rust and returns the new composite, so what you see
  is always the compositor's output rather than anything the browser stacked.

### Blend modes

The twelve **separable** modes from the W3C compositing spec: Normal, Multiply,
Screen, Overlay, Darken, Lighten, Color Dodge, Color Burn, Hard Light, Soft
Light, Difference, Exclusion.

The four non-separable modes (Hue, Saturation, Color, Luminosity) need all three
channels at once and are not implemented.

### Compositing math

For a source with alpha `as` over a backdrop with alpha `ab`, per channel:

```text
Cs' = (1 - ab) * Cs + ab * B(Cb, Cs)          // blend against the backdrop
ao  = as + ab * (1 - as)                      // source-over alpha
Co  = (as * Cs' + ab * Cb * (1 - as)) / ao    // back to non-premultiplied
```

`as` is the layer's own per-pixel alpha multiplied by its opacity. Accumulation
runs in `f32` with non-premultiplied alpha and quantizes to `u8` once at the end,
so a tall stack does not accumulate rounding error.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- Over a fully transparent backdrop every blend mode shows the source unchanged —
  there is nothing to blend against.
- Pixels that end up fully transparent are emitted as `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. Colour under
  zero alpha is invisible, so it is not carried into the composite even when the
  source layer stored something there.

### Samples

`samples/sample.png` (640×400) is a gradient with a grid and soft transparent
edges. `samples/rings.png` is a matching-size ring pattern on a transparent
surround. Open the first and add the second to see blend modes at work.

## Phase 2: composite delivery

Phase 1 shipped the flattened composite as a `data:image/png;base64,…` string
inside every command's JSON response — simple, but base64 inflates the bytes
by a third and the whole thing rides the same IPC channel as everything else.

Phase 2 replaces that with a `composite://` custom protocol registered on the
Tauri app. Each edit still re-flattens and PNG-encodes in Rust, but the raw
bytes are cached in `AppState` behind a generation counter instead of encoded
into the response; the command now returns just that counter. The frontend
points its `<img>` at `composite://composite.png?g=<generation>` and lets the
webview fetch the bytes directly as a normal image request — no base64, no
JSON string, no size limit from what IPC can carry as text.

This is the transport half of the "worth flagging" note from Phase 1.
Recompositing only the dirty region instead of the whole document on every
edit is still future work — there's no per-pixel edit tool yet to make a
"dirty region" mean anything narrower than "the whole layer."

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm — https://nodejs.org
- **Rust** (stable) — https://rustup.rs
- **Platform toolchain** for Tauri v2:
  - **macOS** — Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
  - **Windows** — [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
    and [WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
    (preinstalled on Windows 11)
  - **Linux** — `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf libxdo-dev libssl-dev`

  The full per-platform list lives at https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/

## Run it

```bash
npm install        # once
npm run tauri:dev
```

The first launch compiles the Rust dependency tree and takes a few minutes; later
launches start in seconds. A desktop window opens — click **Open PNG…** and pick
`samples/sample.png`.

Editing anything under `src/` hot-reloads the window. Editing anything under
`src-tauri/src/` recompiles and restarts the app automatically.

## Build a distributable

```bash
npm run tauri:build
```

Installers are written to `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/` (`.dmg` on macOS,
`.msi`/`.exe` on Windows, `.deb`/`.AppImage` on Linux).

## Tests

```bash
cd src-tauri && cargo fmt --check
cd src-tauri && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cd src-tauri && cargo test      # 58 tests: blend math, model, compositor, protocol, pipeline
npm run build                   # frontend: typecheck + production build
```

These same five commands run in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on every push to
`main` and every pull request, in two parallel jobs. The Rust job installs the
GTK/WebKit headers Tauri needs on Linux; it does **not** build the frontend
first, because `tauri::generate_context!` tolerates a missing `dist/` — only a
real bundle needs it.

A third job, `rust-windows`, runs the same `fmt`/`clippy`/`test` trio on
`windows-latest` (WebView2 ships preinstalled there, so no system deps to
install). It only runs on pushes to `main` and on manual dispatch, not on
every PR — Windows minutes bill at 2x on this private repo, so PRs stay
Linux-only for fast, cheap feedback, and the Windows build is checked when a
branch actually lands.

macOS builds and the native file dialog are still unverified.

The Rust suite is where the behaviour is pinned: blend-function identities and
singularities, layer operations and their error paths, compositing (opacity,
visibility, stacking order, alpha accumulation), and end-to-end runs over the
bundled samples. The frontend is a thin shell over those commands and is covered
by the typecheck plus the production build.

## How an image gets on screen

1. React sends a file path, or a layer edit, to one of the Rust commands in
   `lib.rs`. The open document lives in Rust behind a mutex; the frontend holds
   no pixel data.
2. The command mutates the `Document`, re-runs the compositor, PNG-encodes the
   result, and caches those bytes in `AppState` behind a generation counter. It
   returns that counter together with the new layer state — not the bytes.
3. React points its `<img>` at `composite://composite.png?g=<generation>`. The
   webview's own resource fetch hits the `composite://` protocol registered in
   `lib.rs`, which serves the cached bytes straight back, no IPC round trip for
   the pixels themselves.

One command call per edit either way, but the composite no longer inflates
through base64 or shares the IPC channel with everything else — files up to
the 64 MB decode ceiling ship as a plain binary response. Recompositing only
the dirty region instead of the whole document on every edit is the next
natural step once there's a per-pixel edit tool to make "dirty region" mean
something.
