## Phase 1: document model and compositor

A document is a stack of layers. Each layer owns document-sized RGBA8 pixel data
plus **opacity**, a **blend mode**, and a **visibility** flag. The compositor
flattens the stack, bottom to top, into the single image on screen.

- **Open PNG…** starts a new document with that image as its only layer.
- **Add layer…** (or dropping a second file) stacks another image on top. The
  document keeps its original size: smaller images are pasted at the origin,
  larger ones are clipped.
- The layers panel lists the stack top-first. Per layer you can toggle
  visibility, set opacity, choose a blend mode, reorder, and delete.
- Every edit re-flattens in Rust and returns the new composite, so what you see
  is always the compositor's output rather than anything the browser stacked.

### Blend modes

The twelve **separable** modes from the W3C compositing spec: Normal, Multiply,
Screen, Overlay, Darken, Lighten, Color Dodge, Color Burn, Hard Light, Soft
Light, Difference, Exclusion.

The four non-separable modes (Hue, Saturation, Color, Luminosity) need all three
channels at once and are not implemented.

### Compositing math

For a source with alpha `as` over a backdrop with alpha `ab`, per channel:

```text
Cs' = (1 - ab) * Cs + ab * B(Cb, Cs)          // blend against the backdrop
ao  = as + ab * (1 - as)                      // source-over alpha
Co  = (as * Cs' + ab * Cb * (1 - as)) / ao    // back to non-premultiplied
```

`as` is the layer's own per-pixel alpha multiplied by its opacity. Accumulation
runs in `f32` with non-premultiplied alpha and quantizes to `u8` once at the end,
so a tall stack does not accumulate rounding error.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- Over a fully transparent backdrop every blend mode shows the source unchanged —
  there is nothing to blend against.
- Pixels that end up fully transparent are emitted as `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. Colour under
  zero alpha is invisible, so it is not carried into the composite even when the
  source layer stored something there.

### Samples

`samples/sample.png` (640×400) is a gradient with a grid and soft transparent
edges. `samples/rings.png` is a matching-size ring pattern on a transparent
surround. Open the first and add the second to see blend modes at work.

## Phase 2: composite delivery

Phase 1 shipped the flattened composite as a `data:image/png;base64,…` string
inside every command's JSON response — simple, but base64 inflates the bytes
by a third and the whole thing rides the same IPC channel as everything else.

Phase 2 replaces that with a `composite://` custom protocol registered on the
Tauri app. Each edit still re-flattens and PNG-encodes in Rust, but the raw
bytes are cached in `AppState` behind a generation counter instead of encoded
into the response; the command now returns just that counter. The frontend
points its `<img>` at `composite://composite.png?g=<generation>` and lets the
webview fetch the bytes directly as a normal image request — no base64, no
JSON string, no size limit from what IPC can carry as text.

This is the transport half of the "worth flagging" note from Phase 1.
Recompositing only the dirty region instead of the whole document on every
edit is still future work here — there's no per-pixel edit tool yet to make a
"dirty region" mean anything narrower than "the whole layer" (Phase 6 adds
that once Phase 3 gives it something to be dirty about).

## Phase 3: brush and eraser

Phases 1 and 2 only ever replaced or recomposited whole layers; nothing let you
touch an individual pixel. Phase 3 adds that: a **Brush** and an **Eraser**,
selected from the toolbar, that paint or erase on the selected layer wherever
you drag across the canvas.

- `Document::stroke` (`src-tauri/src/document.rs`) applies a tool along a
  polyline of document-pixel coordinates, onto one layer's own pixels — not
  the composite. Consecutive points are joined into capsule-shaped segments
  (a point-to-segment distance test per pixel in the stroke's bounding box),
  so a fast drag has no gaps between samples, with a soft 1px edge rather
  than a hard-aliased circle.
- Coverage from segments that overlap **within one call** is taken as a
  maximum, not summed — a stroke that briefly doubles back on itself (a tight
  curve, a corner) does not paint or erase that overlap twice as hard as the
  rest of the stroke.
- The **Brush** paints an RGBA colour with normal, `source-over` blending —
  the same math `composite.rs` uses to stack layers, applied here to a
  layer's own pixels instead of the accumulated backdrop.
- The **Eraser** multiplies existing alpha down toward zero rather than
  painting; colour is left alone, since a fully transparent pixel's colour is
  invisible and not otherwise meaningful.
- The frontend (`App.tsx`) tracks a pointer drag across the canvas `<img>`,
  converts each event to document-pixel coordinates from the element's
  bounding rect, and sends just the segment since the last point — the
  `paint_stroke` / `erase_stroke` commands — once per pointer move. Each
  call's own bounding box (and the coverage work behind it) stays small
  regardless of how long the drag has run; the stroke is many small edits,
  not one command holding a growing point list.

One thing this does *not* do yet: recomposite only the dirty region instead
of the whole document on every stroke segment (Phase 2's deferred note — now
that there's an actual per-pixel edit tool, this is the next natural
candidate). Phase 6 adds it.

## Phase 4: exporting

Every prior phase could open, edit, and preview a document, but nothing wrote
the result back to disk — editing something with no way to save it is not
yet an editor. **Export PNG…** closes that gap: it flattens the open document
and writes it to a `.png` file at a path chosen through the OS save dialog.

- `export()` (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`) is the same `flatten` + `png::encode`
  pipeline every edit already runs to refresh the on-screen composite, just
  written to a file instead of cached for the `composite://` protocol. It
  reads the open document; it does not touch it, so unlike every other
  command there is no new `Snapshot` — success or an error string is all the
  frontend gets back.
- `export_png` needed a new capability, `dialog:allow-save`, alongside the
  `dialog:allow-open` Phase 0 already granted for **Open PNG…**.

Exporting is deliberately a flattened PNG, not a save of the editable
document (layers, blend modes, opacity): the app's only file format so far
is PNG, on both the read and write side, and a project format able to round
trip the full layer stack is a bigger, separate piece of scope than "make
the button that writes a file exist."

## Phase 5: undo and redo

Every edit so far was one-way — a mistake meant reopening the file. Phase 5
adds **Undo** and **Redo** (toolbar buttons, and Ctrl/Cmd+Z /
Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z / Ctrl+Y), backed by whole-document snapshots kept in Rust.

- `AppState` gained a `history: Mutex<History>` — two `VecDeque<Document>`
  stacks, `undo` and `redo`, each bounded at 50 entries (`MAX_HISTORY`; the
  oldest entry drops off rather than growing forever). Every mutating
  command's `Snapshot` now also carries `canUndo`/`canRedo`, so the toolbar
  buttons enable and disable themselves without a separate query.
- **Checkpointing is gesture-granular, not call-granular.** A brush stroke or
  an opacity drag sends many small IPC calls (one per pointer move); auto-
  checkpointing each one would fragment a single stroke into dozens of undo
  steps. Instead the frontend calls a dedicated `checkpoint` command once, at
  the *start* of a gesture, and the gesture's own edit commands
  (`paint_stroke`, `erase_stroke`, `set_layer_opacity`) use a plain,
  non-checkpointing `edit()` helper. Discrete one-shot commands (add a layer,
  toggle visibility, change blend mode, reorder, delete) checkpoint
  themselves via `edit_checkpointed()`.
- A new checkpoint clears the redo stack — standard editor semantics: you
  cannot redo past a new edit. Opening a new document resets history
  entirely, rather than letting you undo into whatever was open before.
- **A real async-ordering bug, found only by live testing.** The original
  `handlePointerDown` fired `checkpoint()` and `applyStroke(...)` back to
  back with no `await` between them. Two `invoke()` calls issued in the same
  synchronous tick have no guaranteed processing order on the Rust side —
  each becomes an independent async task racing for the same
  `std::sync::Mutex` — so the paint command's response sometimes overwrote
  the frontend's undo-state before the checkpoint's own response landed,
  leaving Undo visibly stuck disabled after a stroke. Rust unit tests could
  never catch this (they call `perform_undo`/`push_checkpoint` synchronously,
  with no IPC involved); only interactive testing under Xvfb surfaced it. The
  fix makes the ordering explicit: `checkpoint().then(() => applyStroke(...))`.

## Phase 6: dirty-region recompositing

Every edit through Phase 5 re-flattened the *entire* document, every time —
including once per pointer-move during a brush stroke, dozens of times over
one drag. Deferred at the end of Phase 2 as future work, and again at the end
of Phase 3 once there was finally a per-pixel edit tool to make "dirty
region" mean something narrower than "the whole layer."

- `composite::flatten` is unchanged in signature and behaviour — same input,
  same output — but its blend math was factored into a new `composite_pixel`
  function that composites exactly one pixel. A new `composite::recomposite_region`
  reuses that same function over just a `Rect` (a bounding box, already
  clamped to the document) instead of the whole image, writing into an
  existing full-size buffer rather than allocating a fresh one. `flatten` and
  `recomposite_region` sharing one blend implementation means there is
  exactly one place for that math to be correct, not two copies that could
  quietly drift apart.
- `Document::stroke` already computed its own touched bounding box internally
  (to size its coverage buffer); it now returns that box (`Option<Rect>`,
  `None` for an empty or entirely-off-canvas stroke) instead of discarding it.
- `AppState`'s composite cache now holds the raw RGBA pixel buffer, not just
  the PNG-encoded bytes. `snapshot()` takes an `Option<Rect>`: given one, and
  a cached buffer whose dimensions match the current document, it patches
  just that rect via `recomposite_region` instead of calling `flatten`.
  Every edit that is *not* a stroke (opacity, visibility, blend mode, adding/
  removing/reordering a layer) can change any pixel in the composite, so
  those still pass `None` and get a full flatten — as does undo/redo, and
  opening a document (which also replaces the cache outright, so a
  differently-sized new image can never be patched against a stale buffer).
- The PNG is still re-encoded from the full buffer on every edit either way —
  encoding was never the expensive part. What a dirty stroke segment now
  skips is the O(width × height × layers) blend loop over pixels nothing
  touched; for a small brush radius on a normal-sized canvas, a stroke
  segment's rect is a small fraction of the total pixel count.

**Verified two ways.** `composite.rs` gained tests asserting a region
recomposite matches a full flatten *inside* the rect and leaves pixels
*outside* it untouched (with a sentinel value nothing real could produce, so
any stray write is unmistakable); `lib.rs` gained tests for `snapshot`'s
three paths — a region patch, the no-cache-yet fallback, and the
dimension-mismatch fallback. Every one of Phase 1-5's existing tests also
still passes unchanged, which is what confirms the `flatten` refactor
(reordering the blend loop from layer-outer/pixel-inner to
pixel-outer/layer-inner, so it could share `composite_pixel` with the region
path) produces identical output to before — not just similar, bit-identical,
pixel for pixel. Live under Xvfb: painted two separate strokes across an
open document and confirmed both rendered correctly with the background
gradient untouched around them, then undid both and confirmed the canvas
returned to its pristine state — the full-flatten fallback undo/redo already
used stays correct alongside the new region path.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and npm — https://nodejs.org
- **Rust** (stable) — https://rustup.rs
- **Platform toolchain** for Tauri v2:
  - **macOS** — Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
  - **Windows** — [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
    and [WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
    (preinstalled on Windows 11)
  - **Linux** — `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev librsvg2-dev patchelf libxdo-dev libssl-dev`

  The full per-platform list lives at https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/

## Run it

```bash
npm install        # once
npm run tauri:dev
```

The first launch compiles the Rust dependency tree and takes a few minutes; later
launches start in seconds. A desktop window opens — click **Open PNG…** and pick
`samples/sample.png`.

Editing anything under `src/` hot-reloads the window. Editing anything under
`src-tauri/src/` recompiles and restarts the app automatically.

## Build a distributable

```bash
npm run tauri:build
```

Installers are written to `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/` (`.dmg` on macOS,
`.msi`/`.exe` on Windows, `.deb`/`.AppImage` on Linux).

## Tests

```bash
cd src-tauri && cargo fmt --check
cd src-tauri && cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cd src-tauri && cargo test      # 84 tests: blend math, model, strokes, compositor, dirty-region recompositing, protocol, export, undo/redo, pipeline
npm run build                   # frontend: typecheck + production build
```

These same five commands run in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on every push to
`main` and every pull request, in two parallel jobs. The Rust job installs the
GTK/WebKit headers Tauri needs on Linux; it does **not** build the frontend
first, because `tauri::generate_context!` tolerates a missing `dist/` — only a
real bundle needs it.

A third job, `rust-windows`, runs the same `fmt`/`clippy`/`test` trio on
`windows-latest` (WebView2 ships preinstalled there, so no system deps to
install). It only runs on pushes to `main` and on manual dispatch, not on
every PR — Windows minutes bill at 2x on this private repo, so PRs stay
Linux-only for fast, cheap feedback, and the Windows build is checked when a
branch actually lands.

macOS builds and the native file dialog are still unverified.

The Rust suite is where the behaviour is pinned: blend-function identities and
singularities, layer operations and their error paths, brush and eraser
strokes (coverage, segment continuity, overlap handling, clipping),
compositing (opacity, visibility, stacking order, alpha accumulation),
exporting a document round-trips through PNG intact, undo/redo (checkpoint,
history bounding, redo-cleared-on-new-edit, the "nothing to undo/redo" error
paths), and end-to-end runs over the bundled samples. The frontend is a thin
shell over those commands and is covered by the typecheck plus the production
build.

## How an image gets on screen

1. React sends a file path, or a layer edit, to one of the Rust commands in
   `lib.rs`. The open document lives in Rust behind a mutex; the frontend holds
   no pixel data.
2. The command mutates the `Document`, re-runs the compositor — the whole
   document, or (for a stroke) just the rect it touched, see Phase 6 —
   PNG-encodes the result, and caches both the raw pixels and the encoded
   bytes in `AppState` behind a generation counter. It returns that counter
   together with the new layer state — not the bytes.
3. React points its `<img>` at `composite://composite.png?g=<generation>`. The
   webview's own resource fetch hits the `composite://` protocol registered in
   `lib.rs`, which serves the cached bytes straight back, no IPC round trip for
   the pixels themselves.

One command call per edit either way, but the composite no longer inflates
through base64 or shares the IPC channel with everything else — files up to
the 64 MB decode ceiling ship as a plain binary response.
